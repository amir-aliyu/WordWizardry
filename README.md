# WordWizardry

To work the word wizardry website, first enter a word into the top textbox to find a synonym for it. 
The textbox below is optional, but it has the option to find synonyms for a given word that either start with or end with certain letters. 
You can input one or multiple letters into each textbox. 
This website is also great for expanding vocabulary:
If you click on the 'generate a random word' box, it will give you a pop-up containing a random word. 
Make sure to find the random word's synonyms!
